# Kingdom Architect
> Medieval simulation/city builder game for the browser.

Kingdom architects is intended to be a combined simulation and city building game around building your own kingdom

The goal of the client is to write it without any included libraries, only the api's provided by the browser. (Why? mostly just as a challenge)

## Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Development setup
